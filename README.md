## 📍 Status
- Role: Software Engineer Trainee (React + Java)
- Background: Python + C++
- Phase: JavaScript Core Foundations

---

## 🎯 Learning Goals
- Master JavaScript fundamentals + internals
- Build strong mental model of execution
- Understand how browsers + JS engines work
- Be ahead of typical React devs by knowing JS deeply
- Connect with React, performance, and real UI behavior

---

## 🧩 Training Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Foundations (Core JS)
- [x] Why JavaScript exists today
- [x] JS vs Browser vs Node (environment difference)
- [x] Single-threaded design for UI
- [x] Event-driven execution model
- [x] Pass-by-value vs pass-by-reference
- [x] Shadowing (var/let/const)
- [ ] Types & coercion
- [ ] Equality (== vs ===)
- [ ] Scope (block, function, global)
- [ ] Primitive vs non-primitive
- [ ] Hoisting rules
- [ ] `this` binding overview

---

### Phase 2 — Internals (Deep JS)
- [ ] Execution Context (GEC + FEC)
- [ ] Creation vs Execution phases
- [ ] Lexical Environment
- [ ] Scope Chain resolution
- [ ] Closures
- [ ] TDZ (Temporal Dead Zone)
- [ ] Call Stack + Heap
- [ ] Memory reference model

---

### Phase 3 — Async & Concurrency
- [ ] Event Loop Architecture
- [ ] Microtask vs Macrotask queues
- [ ] Promises internally
- [ ] async/await under the hood
- [ ] Job queues vs callback queues
- [ ] Rendering pipeline + scheduling

---

### Phase 4 — React Connection
- [ ] Closures in hooks
- [ ] State batching
- [ ] Re-render mechanics
- [ ] Fiber scheduler concepts
- [ ] Concurrent rendering
- [ ] Stale state & stale closure issues

---

### Phase 5 — Advanced / Senior Level
- [ ] V8 Internals (Ignition + TurboFan)
- [ ] Hidden classes
- [ ] Inline caching
- [ ] Optimization vs de-optimization
- [ ] Performance profiling
- [ ] Memory leaks & GC behavior

---

## 🧠 Concepts Learned (Notes)

> Each topic will have notes + examples + interview reasoning.  
> Example:

**Pass-by-value vs Pass-by-reference**
- JS always pass-by-value
- non-primitives pass value-of-reference
- object mutation vs reassignment
- why interview confusion exists

More sections will be added as training continues.

## 🎓 Interview Readiness Checklist
- [ ] Explain event loop
- [ ] Explain hoisting
- [ ] Shadowing examples
- [ ] Closure use cases
- [ ] Difference: var/let/const
- [ ] Why JS single-threaded
- [ ] Micro vs macro tasks

---

## 💼 Intern Reality → Engineering Reality
Understanding why:
- React works the way it does
- browsers prioritize determinism > speed
- JS designed for UI not HPC
- async design prevents race conditions
- function-level behavior affects UI quality

---

## 🔗 Future Additions
- Code examples
- Deep dive docs
- Interview Q&A collection
- React-specific sections
- Senior JS patterns
- Performance notes

---

## 🏁 Goal Outcome
Become a **JS + React engineer** with:
- strong fundamentals
- strong async reasoning
- browser + runtime understanding
- better decision making
- better debugging skills
- superior interview prep
- future senior dev foundation
